# Password-Manager
This app allows users to sign up to a website of their choice, by inputing a username(email) and password. If needed the "Password Manager" also generates a password for the user to avoid duplication in the data. In addition, if the username or password already exists in the database the user will be prompted with an "ERROR" message and to try again.
